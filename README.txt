Our goal is to alert the administration if the fish tank conditions are not ideal for the fish. 
To accomplish this goal, our Python code contains the check_values function. This function is supposed to alert the administration about Temperature values, pH levels, and conductivity levels. 
Unfortunately, we could not test these functionalities because we could not access the pH level sensor, conductivity level sensor, and some other essential items. 
We are planning to work on that in the winter 2024 quarter.
